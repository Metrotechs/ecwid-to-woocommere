## Features

### ðŸŸ¢ Full Data Sync with Preview
- **Automatic Preview:** On page load, fetches and displays a preview of categories and products to be synced, with item counts.
- **Two-Phase Sync:** 
  - **Phase 1:** Imports all Ecwid categories, preserving parent/child relationships.
  - **Phase 2:** Imports all enabled Ecwid products, supporting both simple and variable product types.
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time progress bars and status updates for each sync phase.
- **Live Logging:** Detailed, categorized logs (info, success, warning, error) for every operation.

### ðŸŸ¢ Category Sync & Hierarchy Management
- **Category Preview:** Dedicated tab to preview and sync categories independently.
- **Hierarchy Fix Tool:** "Fix Category Hierarchy" button resolves parent-child relationships if parents were imported after children, using a placeholder system.
- **Placeholder Management:** Temporary "Ecwid Placeholder" posts and terms are created for missing parents, with a dedicated admin menu for review.

### ðŸŸ¢ Selective Product Sync
- **Product Selection:** Load all Ecwid products for selection; choose individual or all products for import/update.
- **Bulk Actions:** "Select All/None" for efficient bulk selection.
- **Per-Product Logging:** See detailed logs for each selected product.

### ðŸŸ¢ Product & Variation Data Handling
- **Comprehensive Data Import:** Names, SKUs, descriptions, prices (regular/sale), stock, weight, dimensions, images, and publish status.
- **Attribute & Variation Support:** 
  - Ecwid options are mapped to WooCommerce global attributes and terms.
  - Missing attribute terms are auto-created during sync.
  - Variations are created for all Ecwid combinations, with per-variation data (SKU, price, stock, etc.).
  - Stale WooCommerce variations are cleaned up if removed from Ecwid.

### ðŸŸ¢ AJAX-Powered Batch Processing
- **Batch Size Control:** Sync operations are performed in small, configurable batches to prevent server timeouts.
- **Live Feedback:** Progress bars, animated status messages, and real-time logs keep you informed.

### ðŸŸ¢ Idempotent & Safe Re-Syncing
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Existing WooCommerce terms and products are matched by Ecwid ID (or SKU as fallback) to avoid duplicates.
- **Meta Fields:** Ecwid IDs are stored in WooCommerce meta fields for categories (`_ecwid_category_id`), products (`_ecwid_product_id`), and variations (`_ecwid_variation_id`).

### ðŸŸ¢ Error Handling & Troubleshooting
- **API Response Validation:** Strict checks for required fields in Ecwid API responses.
- **Detailed Error Logs:** AJAX and API errors are logged with clear messages.
- **Sync Cancellation:** A bright red "STOP SYNC" button allows you to halt a sync in progress, with immediate feedback in the log.
